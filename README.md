Provisional description
--------------
The [Theseus](http://theseus.fi/) open repository contains metadata about more than 90,000 theses from the different Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland. This final year project will focus on analyzing and building a data product based on the thesis keywords. The goal of this project is to build a web application that let users visualize popular thesis topics by department and trends over time. During the project, the quality of the thesis keywords to represent the thesis topics will be evaluated, a suitable technology stack based on Python and JavaScript for building a data product will be chosen and the product features will be further specified. Identifying the different fields of studies and clustering the departments based on the thesis keywords would also be interesting.
